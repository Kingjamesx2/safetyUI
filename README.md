React (UI framework)
TypeScript (Type safety for the React app)
Vite (Fast bundler and build tool)
Storybook (UI component development and documentation)
Tools:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for development
npm or yarn for package management
ESLint for linting and code style enforcement
Prettier for code formatting


4. Key Features
React & TypeScript: Build scalable and type-safe React components.
Vite: Lightning-fast development build tool for better performance.
Storybook: Create and document UI components in isolation.
